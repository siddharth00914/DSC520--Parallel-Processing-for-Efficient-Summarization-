# DSC520--Parallel-Processing-for-Efficient-Summarization

⚡ Parallel Processing for Efficient Text Summarization with Python

This project showcases a high-performance, scalable approach to text summarization using DistilBART, a lightweight transformer model, enhanced through parallel processing in Python. It significantly reduces summarization time while maintaining quality, making it ideal for real-time applications like news summarization, research review, and data monitoring.


🚀 Project Highlights

- 🧠 **Model Used**: DistilBART from HuggingFace Transformers  
- 🧵 **Parallel Execution**: Leveraged `concurrent.futures` for concurrent summarization  
- 📉 **Performance Gain**: ~14.12% improvement in execution time  
- 🧪 **Benchmarking**: Compared serial vs. parallel execution, and core-wise impact  
- 📈 **Visualization**: Matplotlib-based graphs to illustrate performance metrics
